# unicode-writer

**unicode-writer** is a lightweight background program that enables you to easily type Unicode characters using a standard ASCII keyboard.  
It works by intercepting key combinations and translating them into Unicode codepoints, symbols, or letters, depending on your selected input mode.

## Features

- **Type any Unicode character** from a basic keyboard layout
-  **Customizable modifier keys** (e.g. `CtrlR+Insert`, `Alt+Ctrl+K`)
- Multiple input modes (`numpad`, `letter`, `hex`, `base64`)
- Designed with support for non-US keyboard layouts
- Smart key handling to avoid clashes with OS-level shortcuts
- Easily editable config files (JSON)
